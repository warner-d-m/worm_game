A game where you guide an axolotl towards worms using the mouse curser whilst avoiding a predatory carp. All written in html & javascript.

Player score is countered by how many worms the axolotl manages to eat before being caught by the carp. The axolotl also grows in size for each worm eaten, increasing the diffulty as the score counter goes up. The axolotl growing in size provides the player with both a sense of visual progression for each round, and also ease at the start of each new round (as the axolotl is otherwise smaller) - maintaining an engaging gameplay loop.
