worm_game, an easy to pick up game where you guide an axolotl towards worms using the mouse curser whilst avoiding a predatory carp; All written in html & javascript.

Player score is countered by how many worms the axolotl manages to eat before being caught by the carp. The axolotl also grows in size for each worm eaten (using an exponetnal decay function, ensuring the axolotl never actually grows larger than the carp), increasing the difficulty as the score counter goes up. 

The axolotl growing in size provides the player with both a sense of visual progression for each round and ease at the start of each new round (as the axolotl is otherwise smaller) - maintaining an engaging gameplay loop.

The otherwise child-like visuals, silly language, and two-frame animation style (each object consists of two images switching each second) provides a charming and freshing feeling to the game.
